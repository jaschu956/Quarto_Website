# Data Preparation

First, we need to:

1.  load **packages**
2.  read in **data**
3.  check if that data is *in the right format*

[By "right format", we mean that the data is tidy, and ready to be summarized and graphed]{.aside}

## Chossing Data

> Penguins are very cute!

... so let's work with penguin data today.

::: callout-note
For this analysis we will use the `penguins` dataset from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)package[@gorman2014].
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Expand to learn more about where the data was collected

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.
:::

## Loading packages and reading data

::: {.callout-important .smaller}
### Using the data without downloading it

This same dataset is also available in the `palmerpenguins` package
:::

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gt)

```

## Reading Data

```{r}
#| label: head-data

head(penguins)
```

## Cleaning Data

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-data
glimpse(penguins)

penguins |>
  drop_na() -> penguins_no_na

penguins_no_na
```

We have removed missing values here, which means that the data has now `r nrow(penguins_no_na)` rows. Note that previously there were `r nrow(penguins)` rows in the original data.[^1]

[^1]: Note that this removes any rows with missing values!

## Code Annotation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                        # <1>
  mutate(                                          # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm,   # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm    # <2>
  )                                                # <2>
```

1. Take `penguins`, and then,
2. add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.
